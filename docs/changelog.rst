Changelog
=========

v1.2.0dev
---------

API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~
+ ``n_folds`` and ``n_iter`` parameters have been renamed to ``n_splits`` to
  conform to the ``sklearn`` API.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ Added support for ``TimeSeriesSplit`` and ``LeavePOut`` cross-validators.
+ Improved ``osprey dump`` JSON output. The hyperparameters for each run are now stored along all
  the other settings in the same dictionary, allowing for subsequent easier loading and plotting.
+ Added ``max_param_suggestion_retries`` entry to the config file. This limits the number of times that
  ``strategy.suggest`` is called when attempting to produce a trial with a set of params not previously
  tested in the history.
